# FreshLocal - Vendor Terms of Service

**Last updated: 25 February 2026**

These Vendor Terms of Service ("Vendor Terms") govern your participation as a vendor on the FreshLocal platform. By creating a vendor account, you agree to these Vendor Terms in addition to our general Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

These terms form a legally binding agreement between you (the "Vendor") and FreshLocal Ltd ("FreshLocal", "we", "us", or "our"), a company registered in England and Wales.

## 1. Becoming a Vendor

### 1.1 Eligibility

To sell on FreshLocal, you must:

- Be at least 18 years of age.
- Be based in the United Kingdom.
- Be registered as a food business with your local authority (or complete registration before your first sale).
- Comply with all applicable food safety laws and regulations.
- Provide accurate business information during the application process.

### 1.2 Verification

FreshLocal may request documentation to verify your identity, business registration, food hygiene rating, and compliance with food safety regulations. We reserve the right to decline or revoke vendor status at our discretion.

### 1.3 Stripe Connect

All vendors must complete Stripe Connect onboarding to receive payments. This includes identity verification and bank account setup as required by Stripe and applicable financial regulations.

## 2. Commission and Fees

### 2.1 Platform Commission

FreshLocal charges a commission of **12% on the total order value** (excluding the customer service fee) for each completed order. This commission covers the use of the Platform, payment processing facilitation, customer acquisition, and support services.

### 2.2 Customer Service Fee

A separate service fee of 5% is charged to customers at checkout. This fee is collected by FreshLocal and is not deducted from the vendor's earnings.

### 2.3 Stripe Processing Fees

Stripe's standard UK processing fees (currently 1.4% + 20p per transaction for UK cards) are deducted from your payout. These fees are set by Stripe and are subject to change. See [Stripe's pricing page](https://stripe.com/gb/pricing) for current rates.

### 2.4 Example Breakdown

For an order with a total value of £20.00:

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Order total (set by you) | £20.00 |
| Customer service fee (5%, paid by customer) | £1.00 |
| FreshLocal commission (12% of £20.00) | -£2.40 |
| Stripe processing fee (1.4% + 20p of £20.00) | -£0.48 |
| **Your payout** | **£17.12** |

### 2.5 Commission Changes

We will provide at least 30 days' written notice before any changes to the commission rate. You may terminate your vendor account if you do not agree with the new rate.

## 3. Payouts

### 3.1 Payout Schedule

Payouts are made **weekly on Tuesdays** via Stripe Connect to the bank account you have registered. Payouts cover all completed orders from the previous week (Monday to Sunday).

### 3.2 Minimum Payout

The minimum payout amount is £5.00. If your earnings for a given week are below this threshold, the balance will carry over to the following week.

### 3.3 Payout Holds

FreshLocal may place a temporary hold on payouts in the following circumstances:

- A dispute or refund claim is pending on one or more orders.
- We have reason to suspect fraudulent activity.
- Your account is under review for policy violations.
- Stripe requires additional verification.

We will notify you promptly if a hold is placed and will release funds as soon as the matter is resolved.

### 3.4 Taxes

You are responsible for all tax obligations related to your earnings on FreshLocal, including income tax, National Insurance contributions, and VAT registration (if applicable). FreshLocal does not deduct taxes from your payouts. We recommend consulting a qualified accountant.

---

## 4. Food Safety Obligations

### 4.1 Legal Compliance

As a vendor on FreshLocal, you must comply with all applicable food safety legislation, including but not limited to:

- **Food Safety Act 1990**
- **Food Hygiene Regulations 2013 (England)** (or equivalent regulations in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland)
- **Regulation (EC) No 852/2004** (retained in UK law) on the hygiene of foodstuffs
- **Food Information Regulations 2014** (as amended by Natasha's Law)

### 4.2 Food Business Registration

You must be registered with your local authority as a food business. If you operate from home, this means registering your home kitchen. Registration is free and must be completed at least 28 days before you start trading.

### 4.3 Food Hygiene Rating Scheme

We strongly encourage all vendors to achieve and maintain a Food Hygiene Rating of 3 ("Generally Satisfactory") or above. Vendors with a rating below 3 may be required to demonstrate corrective actions or may have their listings paused until improvement is confirmed.

### 4.4 Allergen Information (Natasha's Law)

Under Natasha's Law (effective from October 2021), all food that is prepacked for direct sale (PPDS) must display a full ingredients list with the 14 major allergens emphasised. As a FreshLocal vendor, you must:

- Provide a complete and accurate list of ingredients for every product listing.
- Clearly identify all 14 regulated allergens (celery, cereals containing gluten, crustaceans, eggs, fish, lupin, milk, molluscs, mustard, nuts, peanuts, sesame, soya, and sulphur dioxide).
- Update allergen information immediately if recipes or suppliers change.
- Respond to customer allergen enquiries promptly and accurately.

Failure to provide accurate allergen information is a serious breach of these Vendor Terms and may result in immediate suspension.

### 4.5 Food Safety Training

We recommend that all vendors and anyone involved in food preparation complete Level 2 Food Safety and Hygiene training (or equivalent). While not currently mandatory for listing on FreshLocal, we may introduce this as a requirement in the future.

## 5. Listing Standards

### 5.1 Accuracy

All product listings must be accurate, truthful, and not misleading. This includes:

- **Product names and descriptions**: Must accurately describe the food item.
- **Photographs**: Must be genuine photos of your food (stock photos are not permitted).
- **Prices**: Must be accurate and inclusive of any applicable VAT.
- **Availability**: Products should be marked as unavailable when you cannot fulfil orders.

- All meat and poultry products are sourced from halal-certified suppliers.

## 6. Ratings and Reviews

### 6.1 Customer Ratings

Customers may rate orders on a scale of 1 to 5 stars and leave written reviews. Your average rating is displayed publicly on your vendor profile.

### 6.2 Rating Thresholds

We use ratings as one indicator of vendor quality and customer satisfaction:

- **Below 3.0 average for 30 consecutive days**: Your account will be placed under review. We will contact you to discuss improvement steps and may offer guidance and support.
- **Below 2.5 average for 30 consecutive days**: Your listings may be suspended until your rating improves. You will need to complete a reinstatement process, which may include a food safety review and improvement plan.
- **Below 2.0 average**: Immediate suspension pending review. Continued poor performance may result in permanent removal from the Platform.

### 6.3 Fraudulent Reviews

FreshLocal has systems to detect and remove fake or fraudulent reviews. Vendors must not incentivise, solicit, or fabricate reviews. Attempting to manipulate ratings is a serious violation and may result in account termination.

---

## 7. Order Management

### 7.1 Accepting Orders

When you receive an order, you should accept or decline it promptly. Orders not responded to within 15 minutes may be automatically cancelled.

### 7.2 Preparation and Collection

You must prepare orders within the estimated preparation time stated on your listing. If delays occur, you should update the customer through the Platform.

### 7.3 Cancellation by Vendor

You may cancel an order if you are genuinely unable to fulfil it (for example, due to ingredient shortage or equipment failure). Frequent vendor-initiated cancellations will negatively affect your vendor score and may trigger a review.

### 7.4 Refunds

When a customer requests a refund related to your order, FreshLocal will review the claim. If the refund is approved due to vendor fault (incorrect order, poor quality, food safety issue), the refund amount may be deducted from your future payouts.
