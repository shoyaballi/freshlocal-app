**Last updated: 25 February 2026**

Welcome to FreshLocal. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the FreshLocal mobile application and website (the "Platform"), operated by FreshLocal Ltd, a company registered in England and Wales.

By creating an account or using FreshLocal, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform.

## 1. About FreshLocal

FreshLocal is a hyperlocal marketplace that connects customers with local halal food vendors, including home kitchens, shops, and pop-up food businesses. We facilitate the discovery, ordering, and payment process, but we do not prepare, handle, or deliver food ourselves. Each vendor is an independent business responsible for their own food preparation, quality, and compliance with applicable laws.

## 2. Eligibility

To use FreshLocal, you must:

- Be at least 18 years of age.
- Be a resident of the United Kingdom.
- Have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement.

By creating an account, you confirm that you meet these requirements.

## 3. Account Registration and Responsibilities

### 3.1 Creating an Account

You may register using your email address or phone number. You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and keep your account details up to date.

### 3.2 Account Security

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. You must notify us immediately at support@freshlocal.co.uk if you suspect any unauthorised access to your account.

### 3.3 One Account Per Person

Each individual may hold only one customer account. Vendors must apply for a separate vendor account, which is subject to the Vendor Terms of Service.

## 4. How Ordering Works

### 4.1 Browsing and Ordering

You can browse vendor listings, view menus, and place orders through the Platform. When you place an order, you are making an offer to purchase from the vendor. The order is confirmed once the vendor accepts it.

### 4.2 Pricing

All prices displayed on the Platform are set by vendors and are shown in British Pounds (GBP) inclusive of VAT where applicable. A platform service fee of 5% is added to the customer's order total at checkout.

### 4.3 Commission

FreshLocal charges vendors a commission of 12% on the total value of each completed order. This commission is deducted from the vendor's payout and does not affect the price you pay as a customer.

### 4.4 Order Accuracy

Please review your order carefully before submitting. Once a vendor has accepted your order, changes may not be possible.

## 5. Payment Processing

All payments are processed securely through Stripe, our third-party payment provider. FreshLocal does not store your full card details. By making a payment, you also agree to Stripe's terms of service and privacy policy.

Accepted payment methods include debit cards, credit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.

## 6. Food Safety

### 6.1 Vendor Responsibility

Vendors listed on FreshLocal are solely responsible for:

- Compliance with the Food Safety Act 1990 and the Food Hygiene Regulations 2013.
- Registration with their local authority as a food business.
- Maintaining appropriate food hygiene standards as set out by the Food Standards Agency (FSA).
- Accurate allergen information and labelling in accordance with Natasha's Law (the UK Food Information Amendment).
- Obtaining and maintaining a satisfactory Food Hygiene Rating.

### 6.2 Platform Role

FreshLocal requires vendors to confirm compliance with food safety regulations as a condition of listing on the Platform. However, we do not inspect vendor premises, and we cannot guarantee the safety, quality, or allergen accuracy of any food sold through the Platform.

### 6.3 Allergen Information

Allergen information is provided by vendors. If you have food allergies or dietary requirements, we strongly recommend contacting the vendor directly before placing an order.

## 7. Cancellation and Refunds

### 7.1 Cancellation by You

You may cancel an order free of charge if the vendor has not yet started preparing it. Once preparation has begun, cancellation may not be possible.

### 7.2 Cancellation by Vendor

Vendors may cancel an order if they are unable to fulfil it (for example, due to ingredient unavailability). In this case, you will receive a full refund.

### 7.3 Refund Policy

- **Full refund**: If the vendor cancels, or if you cancel before preparation begins.
- **Partial or full refund**: If the order is materially different from what was described, arrives in an unacceptable condition, or is significantly late. Refund decisions are made at FreshLocal's reasonable discretion.
- **No refund**: For orders that have been collected or delivered and consumed, or where the complaint is based solely on personal taste preference.

Refunds are processed back to your original payment method and typically take 5 to 10 business days to appear on your statement.

### 7.4 Disputes

If you are not satisfied with a refund decision, you may contact us at support@freshlocal.co.uk. We will review the dispute and respond within 5 business days.

## 8. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Platform for any unlawful purpose.
- Submit false reviews, ratings, or information.
- Harass, abuse, or threaten vendors or other users.
- Attempt to circumvent the Platform to transact directly with vendors.
- Reverse-engineer, copy, or interfere with the Platform's technology.
- Create multiple accounts or share account access.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that breach these rules.

## 9. Intellectual Property

All content on the Platform, including the FreshLocal name, logo, design, and software, is owned by or licensed to FreshLocal Ltd and is protected by intellectual property laws.

Vendors retain ownership of their own product images and descriptions but grant FreshLocal a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to display this content on the Platform for the purpose of facilitating orders.

You may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from any Platform content without our prior written consent.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

### 10.1 Platform Provision

FreshLocal is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. While we strive to maintain a reliable service, we do not guarantee uninterrupted access.

### 10.2 Food-Related Liability

FreshLocal acts as a marketplace and is not the producer or seller of food. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any illness, allergic reaction, injury, or loss arising from the consumption of food ordered through the Platform.

### 10.3 Cap on Liability

To the extent permitted by applicable law, FreshLocal's total liability to you for any claims arising from or related to your use of the Platform shall not exceed the amount you paid through the Platform in the 12 months preceding the claim.

### 10.4 Consumer Rights

Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights as a consumer under UK law, including the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the app or by email. Continued use of the Platform after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes arising from or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
